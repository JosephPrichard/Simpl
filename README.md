# Simpl

Simpl is a simple imperative language designed for teaching programming languages theory. This project implements Simpl as both an untyped interpreter with only ints and an interpreter with a typechecker allowing for both bools and ints. These assignments were done at UTD under Professor Kevin Hamlen.

## Untyped Interpreter

An interpreter for Simpl and an automatic [large step semantics](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4110/2012fa/lectures/lecture04.pdf) deriver.

## Typechecked Interpreter

A typechecked version of the interpreter with support for both integers and booleans.
